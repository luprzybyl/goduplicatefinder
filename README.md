Finds file duplicates in given directory.

# Basic info
I have created this project to have some particular use case to learn Golang.

It's basic feature is to scan given directory, calculate checksum for every file and find duplicates.

At this point it's highly inefficient and will be improved overtime.

Feel free to help me learn it by submitting PRs and issues.
